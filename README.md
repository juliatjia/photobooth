### Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open index.html in your browser
No build tools or server required — it’s a fully static project!


### How It Works
The webcam feed is mirrored and styled to match a vintage camera look.

When the session starts, a countdown and flash simulate the photobooth capture.

Each photo is saved and stacked into a vertical photo strip.

The photo strip “prints” out from a tray slot at the bottom of the viewfinder, just like a real photobooth.

Users can add a caption, message card, and download the final strip.
